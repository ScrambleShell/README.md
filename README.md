# Scramble (Suit) Shell
*The default Multiverse OS shell*

Scramble Shell is a security and privacy by default Linux desktop environment that built ontop of Wayland for the Multiverse OS project.

### Shell

Currently developers are using modified versions of Gnome and modified versions of I3. The plan currently is to upgrad to a common Wayland shell environment, likely built in Rust. Until this has been determined, this organization will be used to store notes and resources related to experimental shell solutions for Multiverse OS.
